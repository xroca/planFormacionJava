       in that it refers to absolute age. Even a Connection which has not been much 
       idle will be purged from the pool if it exceeds maxConnectionAge. 
       Zero means no maximum absolute age is enforced.

           maxIdleTimeExcessConnections is about minimizing the number of 
       Connections held by c3p0 pools when the pool is not under load. By default, 
       c3p0 pools grow under load, but only shrink if Connections fail a Connection 
       test or are expired away via the parameters described above. Some users want 
       their pools to quickly release unnecessary Connections after a spike in usage 
       that forces a large pool size. You can achieve this by setting 
       maxIdleTimeExcessConnections to a value much shorter than maxIdleTime, forcing 
       Connections beyond your set minimum size to be released if they sit idle for 
       more than a short period of time.

        <!-- 
           The point of Connection pooling is to bear the cost of acquiring a Connection 
       only once, and then to reuse the Connection many, many times. Most databases 
       support Connections that remain open for hours at a time. There's no need to churn 
       through all your Connections every few seconds or minutes. Setting maxConnectionAge 
       or maxIdleTime to 1800 (30 minutes) is quite aggressive. For most databases, 
       several hours may be more appropriate. You can ensure the reliability of your 
       Connections by testing them, rather than by tossing them. 
       (see Configuring Connection Testing.) The only one of these parameters that 
       should generally be set to a few minutes or less is maxIdleTimeExcessConnections.

            The most reliable time to test Connections is on check-out. But this 
        is also the most costly choice from a client-performance perspective. Most 
        applications should work quite reliably using a combination of 
        idleConnectionTestPeriod and testConnectionsOnCheckIn. Both the idle test 
        and the check-in test are performed asynchronously, which leads to 
        better performance, both perceived and actual.
